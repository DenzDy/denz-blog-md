- essentially heuristic search methods
	- where we have a rough idea of how good various states are, and use this knowledge to guide our search
## Best-first Search
- uses an evaluation function $f(n)$ for each node
	- $f(n)$ - estimate of desirability
- Expand most desirable unexpanded node
- Implementation: fringe is queue sorted by decreasing order of desirability
### Greedy best-first Search
- Evaluation function $f(n) = h(n)$
- $h(n)$ - estimated cost of the cheapest path from the state at node $n$ to a goal state
- $h(goal) = 0$
- expands the node that **appears** to be closest to the goal
- Optimality: No
- Time complexity: $O(b^m)$
- Space complexity: $O(b^m)$
- Complete: No; can get stuck in loops
	- Sometimes causes unnecessary nodes to be expanded
### More informed search
- New Goal: minimize the overall length of the path to the goal
- Let $g(N)$ be the cost of the best path found between the initial node and $N$
- $f(N)=g(N)+h(N)$
- Conditions for optimality
	- Admissible heuristic
	- Consistent heuristic
#### Admissible Heuristic
- Let $h^*(N)$ be the true cost of the optimal path from $N$ to a goal node
- a heuristic $h(N)$ is admissible if:
	- $0 \leq h(N) \leq h^*(N)$
- admissible heuristic is always optimistic, so the cost of solving the problem is always less than it actually is
#### Consistent Heuristic
- for every node $n$, every successor $n'$ of $n$ generated by any action $a$,
	- $h(n) \leq c(n,a,n') \leq h(n')$
- If $h$ is consistent, then $f(n)$ is non-decreasing along any path
### A* Search
- best-first search with evaluation function:
	- $f(N)=g(N)+h(N)$
	- where:
		- $g(N)$ - cost of best path found so far to $N$
		- $h(N)$ - admissible heuristic (and consistent - required only for graph search)
- developed by Fikes and Nilsson in early 70s
##### A* Search Example
![[Pasted image 20250204234649.png]]
- $f(N) = g(N) + h(N)$
	- $g(N)$ - cost of path from A to B
	- $h(N)$ - straight-line distance to goal (Bucharest)

#### A* Search Evaluation
- Complete: Yes (unless there are infinitely many nodes with $f \leq f(G)$ )
- Time Complexity: Exponential
- Space: Keeps all expanded nodes in memory
- Optimal: Yes
### Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)
- Use $f(N) = g(N) + h(N)$ with admissible and consistent $h$
- Each iteration is depth-first with cutoff on the value of $f$ on expanded nodes
### Heuristics
- intended to orient the search along promising paths
- time spent computing heuristics must be recovered by a better search
